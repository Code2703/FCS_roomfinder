# RoomRadar

## Project Description
With our project we set out to create an overview of study spots at the University of St. Gallen. Such spots include Group Study Rooms, Study Zones (e.g., the library and coworking spaces) and empty lecture rooms. Currently, there are separate websites for booking Group Study Rooms and viewing the capacity of the Study Zones. For lecture rooms, no overview exists at all. Our Web-App introduces the latter and creates a consolidated view.
