# RoomRadar

## Project Description
Our project was conceived with the aim of simplifying the process of finding study spots at the University of St. Gallen. Previously, students had to navigate through a multitude of different websites to access information about the availability of various study spaces, ranging from group meeting rooms and libraries to coworking spaces. However, a crucial piece of the puzzle was often overlooked â€“ the lecture rooms. When could these spaces be utilized for focused study sessions?

Introducing RoomRadar, our solution offers students a unified and comprehensive overview of all potential study spots on campus, encompassing even the availability of empty lecture rooms. In addition, the booking feature allows students to "reserve" lecture rooms during their off-times. While not officially enforceable, this facilitates coordination among students looking for a quiet spot. With RoomRadar, we've streamlined the information-gathering process, providing students with a one-stop platform to plan their study sessions efficiently and effectively.

## Instructions and Dependencies
To get the app running, please create a file 'config.py' in the same directory as app.py. In app.py, specify the following constants:
- `API_TOKEN` - API key access token for the API of the University of St.Gallen (not shareable)
- `SECRET_KEY` - a random encryption key (e.g., a random hex token)
- `DRIVER_PATH` - the path to your browser-driver (required by Selenium; used driver: Google Chrome Driver (https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads/version-selection))

Please refer to requirements.txt for the required modules and used versions (run `pip install -r requirements.txt`). This app was built with Python 3.11.4.

## Implementation Details

### Backend
The app is set up around the `API` class defined in `API_calls.py`. An api object can be initialized as follows: `api = API(API_TOKEN)` 

```python
from API_calls import API
from config import API_TOKEN

# First option using flask function "config.from_pyfile()"
app = Flask(__name__) # Set up the Flask application
app.config.from_pyfile("config.py") # Read API_token from config.py file
api = API(app.config['API_TOKEN']) # Initialize instance of API with api_token

# Second option, importing API_TOKEN from config.py
api = API(API_TOKEN)
```
#### Available functions:
The available functions for the API object are the following:
| Name                                          | Description                                                                                                                                                   |
|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `get_rooms(self)`                             | Returns a pandas dataframe containing all lecture rooms, including their capacity and system IDs. Note that some rooms have multiple IDs.                     |
| `get_courses(self, date=None)`                | Takes in date as a string in the format '%Y-%m-%d'. Returns the schedule for the specified day, i.e., a timetable of all courses and their locations.       |
| `next_event(self, df, room_nr, filter_end)`   | Returns a dataframe containing the next event for a specified room given the day's schedule.                                                                 |
| `get_courses(self, date=None)`                | Input: Filter_start & filter_end as strings with format '%H:%M'; date as string with format '%Y-%m-%d'. Defaults to current date if none is specified. Returns a dataframe of free rooms that match the filter. |
| `filter_rooms(self, rooms_df)`                | Excludes certain buildings and types of rooms when passed a dataframe returned by `get_rooms()`.                                                             |
| `get_schedule(self, room_nr, start_date=None)`| Returns a pandas dataframe containing all events taking place in the specified room for a given date (defaults to current date).                              |
| `old_rooms(self)`                             | Returns a pandas dataframe containing all campus rooms of format xx-(U)xxx, including their capacity and system IDs. Note that some rooms have multiple IDs. Note: use the `get_rooms()` method instead, which accesses the MazeMap API and provides more room details. |


#### Calling API functions:
```python

# Get all room information
rooms_df = api.get_rooms()

# Exclude inaccessible buildings and rooms
filtered_rooms = api.filter_rooms(rooms_df)
```

### Frontend
The application utilizes Bootstrap (<https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/>) to create a smooth and user-friendly experience featuring a polished and straightforward design. Users can input criteria, such as date, timeframe, current location, and maximum room size, using a form. Once the form is submitted, a list of rooms is presented in the form of individual cards, each displaying relevant room details. Additionally, users can access a link for more comprehensive information and navigate through the MazeMap.

The incorporation of Bootstrap elements, including the form, filters, accordion, and various buttons, enhances user interaction with the webpage, providing a cohesive and engaging platform.

## Troubleshooting

#### API availability
On weekends and from time to time during weeks, the API does not respond. During the week, this is usually limited to relatively short timeframes. On Sundays, the API was unavailable the whole day at times.

#### Chrome Driver Version Incompatibility
Ensure your Chrome Driver Version is compatible with the Version of Chrome you are using to access the '/seatfinder.html' route.

#### Accessing the Website from Eduroam
Note that it is currently not possible to access the Website when connected to Eduroam WiFi.
